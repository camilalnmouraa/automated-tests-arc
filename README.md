> I used versions `v20.14.0` and `10.7.0` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest using the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the development dependencies.

## Lint

Run `npm run lint` to check code compliance with lint rules.

## Tests

Run `npm run test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to execute the tests.

## Reports
